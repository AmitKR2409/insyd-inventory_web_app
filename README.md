# Insyd Inventory Transparency Web App

A full-stack inventory management and transparency dashboard built as part of the **Insyd Assignment**.  
The application focuses on improving **trust, accountability, and decision-making** in inventory data by tracking stock changes with reasons and generating actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

### Problem 1  
**Lack of trust in inventory data due to missing transparency and accountability**

### Problem 2  
**Decision paralysis due to lack of actionable insights**

---

## Solution Overview

This application provides:
- Transparent inventory tracking
- Reason-based stock updates
- Complete stock change history
- Automated insights for better decisions

Both **backend APIs** and **frontend dashboard** are fully deployed and connected.

---

## Features

### Inventory Management (Problem 1)
- View inventory items with real-time quantity
- Update stock with positive or negative changes
- Mandatory reason for every stock update
- Automatic logging of stock change history with timestamps

### Actionable Insights (Problem 2)
- Low stock item detection
- Fast-moving items based on change frequency
- Slow-moving items
- Most common stock change reasons (damage, sale, etc.)

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Atlas)
- Mongoose

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas

## Live URLs

### Frontend (Dashboard)
 https://insyd-inventory-web-app.vercel.app

### Backend API
 https://insyd-inventory-web-app.onrender.com/api

### Example API Endpoints
- `/api/items`
- `/api/items/:id/update`
- `/api/items/:id/history`
- `/api/insights`

> **Note:** Backend is hosted on Render (free tier).  
> First request may take ~20–30 seconds if the service is idle.

## How It Works

1. Inventory items are stored in MongoDB
2. Any stock update requires a **reason**
3. Each update is logged with:
   - Quantity change
   - Reason
   - Timestamp
4. Insights are generated by analyzing stock change history
5. Frontend consumes backend APIs to display data in real time

---

## Repository Structure

This repository uses a **single GitHub repo (monorepo)** approach:
- Backend and frontend are maintained in separate folders
- Deployed independently but connected via API

---

## Deployment Status

- Backend successfully deployed on Render
- Frontend successfully deployed on Vercel
- Frontend connected to production backend API
- Fully functional end-to-end system

---

## Sample Use Case

- Select an inventory item
- Reduce quantity due to damage or sale
- Reason is logged automatically
- History updates instantly
- Insights section updates dynamically
